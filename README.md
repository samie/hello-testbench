hello-testbench
===========

Simple Vaadin Hello World application for Vaadin TestBench. This project demonstrates:
 * Vaadin TestBench Maven dependencies
 * Automatic testing with Firefox
 * Clicking buttons and validating Notification and Label values

### Usage:

Make sure you have installed [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/). You also need to have the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed in your machine where you run the tests. 

    git clone https://github.com/samie/hello-testbench.git
    cd hello-testbench
    mvn verify
    
Vaadin TestBench test cases are automatically executed as part of integration test phase. During this phase an embedded 
Jetty server instance is started to run the application itself, and then test case in
[HelloWorldITCase.java](src/test/java/org/vaadin/samples/tests/HelloWorldITCase.java) is executed. This test 
starts Firefox browser and simulates the given user interactions for the application and asserts correct behavior.

You can find the code for the application in [HelloWorldUI.java](src/main/java/org/vaadin/samples/HelloWorldUI.java).
